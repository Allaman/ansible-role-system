# Role Name

This role configures several tasks at the OS level

- installs a host file based (DNS) blocking based upon [energized](https://energized.pro/). The original hosts file is backed up to `/etc/hosts.original` and can be restored by running the role with `hosts_pack: none` again. Have a look at [packs](https://block.energized.pro/) for an overview of available packs and their features.

- allows sudo permissions without password

- configures Thinkpad related settings
